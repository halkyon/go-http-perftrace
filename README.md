# http-perftrace

Experiment with the Go [httptrace](https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/httptrace/) library building a simple CLI tool to output
HTTP performance for a given URL. It's basically like siege or something, but written in Go, and much much simpler.

## TODO

* Double check hooks in `httptrace.ClientTrace` and their correct use in this tool
* Provide some more useful output at the end, maybe 95th percentiles for example
* Add colours
* Add interval between requests (or random interval)
* Add linter, tests, etc

## Installation

`go get github.com/halkyon/http-perftrace`

## Usage

`$ http-perftrace -u https://www.google.com [-c concurrency] [-d duration]`

## Example

```
$ http-perftrace -u https://www.google.com -c 1 -d 1s
Running for 1s with 1 concurrent workers
